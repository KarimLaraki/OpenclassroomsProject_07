Seattle is a seaport city on the West Coast of the United States. It is the seat of King County, Washington. Seattle is the largest city in both the state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America.

Seattle's economy is driven by a mix of older industrial companies, and "new economy" Internet and technology companies, service, design, and clean technology companies.

The City of Seattle goal is to reduce total core greenhouse gas emissions 58% by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2050 (https://www.seattle.gov/environment/environmental-progress/climate-change).

This project take a look at 2015 and 2016 data from non-residentials building, then aim to predict electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
